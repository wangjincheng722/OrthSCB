# OrthSCB
1. Training scripts, logfiles, models for SCNN is in ./SCNN4(8,12)
2. Training scripts, models for Slimming SCNN-4(8,12) is in ./SCNN4(8,12)_Slim, logfiles is not presented since it is too large(>25MB).
3. Training scripts, models for orthogonalize SCNN-4(8,12) is in ./SCNN4(8,12)_Orth, logfiles is not presented .
4. Implmentation for SparseConvolutionLayer is in ./SparseConvolutionLayer. One can follow the standard configuration with Caffe. Only support CUDA yet.
5. Implmentation for SCNN' orthogonalization is in ./Orthogonalization
