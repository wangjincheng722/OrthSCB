# OrthSCB
1. Training scripts, logfiles, models for SCNN is in ./SCNN8 and ./SCNN12
2. Training scripts, models for Slimming SCNN-8/12 is in ./SCNN8_Slim and ./SCNN12_Slim, logfiles is not presented since it is too large(>25MB)
3. Implmentation for SparseConvolutionLayer is in ./SparseConvolutionLayer. One can follow the standard configuration with Caffe. Only support CUDA yet.
4. Implmentation for SCNN' orthogonalization is in ./Orthogonalization
