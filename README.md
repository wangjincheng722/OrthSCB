# OrthSCB
1. Train scripts, logfiles, resulted models for SCNN is in ./SCNN4(8,12)
2. Train scripts, models for Slimming SCNN-4(8,12) is in ./SCNN4(8,12)_Slim, original logfiles is not presented since the size is too large(>25MB).
3. Train scripts, models for orthogonalized SCNN-4(8,12) is in ./SCNN4(8,12)_Orth.
4. Codes for SparseConvolutionLayer are in ./SparseConvolutionLayer/. One might follow the standard configuration with Caffe. Only support CUDA yet.
