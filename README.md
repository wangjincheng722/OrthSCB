# OrthSCB
1. Training scripts, logfiles, models for SCNN is in ./SCNN8 and ./SCNN12.
2. Training scripts, models for Slimming SCNN-8/12 is in ./SCNN8_Slim and ./SCNN12_Slim, logfiles is not presented since it is too large(>25MB).
3. Training scripts, models for orthogonalize SCNN-8/12 is in ./SCNN8_Orth and ./SCNN12_Orth, logfiles is not presented .
4. Implmentation for SparseConvolutionLayer is in ./SparseConvolutionLayer. One can follow the standard configuration with Caffe. Only support CUDA yet.
5. Implmentation for SCNN' orthogonalization is in ./Orthogonalization
